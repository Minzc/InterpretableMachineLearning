## Chapter 2 interpretability

There is no mathematical definition of interpretability. Two (non-mathematical) definitions are Interpretability are

**The degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision;**

**Interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the modelâ€™s result;** [1]

Note: Personaly, I prefer the second definition, which requires the interpretation to be re-usable.
